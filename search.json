    "text": "I’ve already tested Chat-GPT5 on brain teaser puzzles. How well does it do on Wordle?\nTask: I am going to ask ChatGPT5 to begin a Wordle by giving me a 5 letter word. I am not going to tell the LLM that I will be inputting it into Wordle, so it doesn’t give me an “optimal” word. Then I will describe (in words) the result and ask ChatGPT5 to give me another word as the next prompt. I will continue until the LLM fails or succeeds. Let’s go!\n\nFirst 5-letter word choice: crisp\nReprompt:\n\nthe letter c is in the correct place, every other letter is not present in the word. try again with another 5 letter word.\n\nNext guess: cloak\nReprompt:\n\nthe c is still correct. the o is in the word but doesn’t appear at that location. every other letter is not in the word. try again\n\nNext guess: count\nReprompt:\n\nc and o are in the right place. n appears in the word but not that location. every other letter is not present. try again\n\nNext guess: coven\n\nCorrect!!\n\n\n\nLet’s compare it to Wordle Bot - NYT’s Wordle Analyzer\nLet’s go step by step:\n\nCrisp - Rated 93 skill; 92 words remaining; on average, Wordle Bot can solve it in 3.6 steps with this word\nCloak - Rated 72 skill; 18 words left, Alone would have been a better word\nCount - Rated 74 skill; 4 words left, Month would have been a better word\nCoven - Rated 67 skill, correct word\n\n\n\n\nMy Reflection\nAlthough ChatGPT may not have the best reputation when it comes to solving word puzzles, so far, it seems to be able to solve Wordle! One thing that I wanted to note is that the LLM took a bit longer for each successive round. From round 1 to round 2, it thought for a “few seconds”. From round 2 to round 3, it thought for 9 seconds. THen, from round 3 to round 4, it thought for 11 seconds. I am assuming it was going through potential options to narrow down ones that fit the criteria as the criteria became more and more specific.\nChatGPT didn’t have bad guesses, but they still weren’t optimal. As shown by Wordle Bot, each word after the first was rate a skill number less than 80. However, I think it did a good job in removing words. This may have also been a fault of my own prompts because I worded it in a way that hinted that guesses had the keep the correct letters already guessed. If this was not the case, perhaps the LLM may have guessed the ‘optimal’ word, as determined by Wordle Bot."

    "text": "Do LLM’s have good customer service skills? Let’s find out!\n\nWe know that LLM’s can role play when given a prompt; however, can they deal with a rude customer in an appropriate manner?\nOverview: Using the Anthropic/Claude-3.5-sonnet LLM, I’ll give it two prompts to see how the conversation will play out. For the first one, all I will ask the LLM is to pretend to be a barista. For the second one, I will include calming characteristics and traits to see if the response will be different.\n\nPrompt 1:\n\nPretend you are a barista at a local coffee shop. I will pretend to be the customer.\n\nThe initial order will be the same for both: Get me a hot cappuccino with exactly ¾ of it filled and steamed milk on the side in a cup heated perfectly to 98 degrees Fahrenheit\nClaude: &gt; Maintaining a friendly, professional tone &gt; &gt; I’ll be happy to make you a cappuccino! I can certainly fill it to about ¾ full, and I’ll provide steamed milk on the side. However, I want to be transparent that while we carefully monitor our beverage temperatures, we can’t guarantee an exact temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit, as we don’t have temperature-controlled cups. I can ensure it will be properly hot without being scalding. Would that work for you?\nMe: &gt; sure, whatever. also i want a muffin and my order right now, I am going to be late.\nClaude: &gt; Speaking in a calm, efficient manner &gt; &gt; I understand you’re in a hurry. I’ll get right on your cappuccino. Which type of muffin would you like? We have blueberry, chocolate chip, banana nut, and pumpkin spice available today. &gt; &gt; Starting to prepare the cappuccino while waiting for your muffin selection\nMe: &gt; No I want a strawberry shortcake muffin with fresh strawberries. This service is terrible\nClaude: &gt; Maintaining a professional, patient tone &gt; &gt; I apologize for any inconvenience, but we don’t carry strawberry shortcake muffins or fresh strawberries. I’d be happy to recommend one of our available muffins - blueberry, chocolate chip, banana nut, or pumpkin spice. They’re all baked fresh this morning. &gt; &gt; Continues preparing your cappuccino &gt; &gt; Would you like to try one of these options instead? Or would you prefer just the cappuccino today?\nMe: &gt; Ok whatever just give me the blueberry muffin and my drink, I am leaving and never coming back\nClaude: &gt; Remaining polite and professional while quickly finishing your order &gt; &gt; I’m sorry you’re disappointed with our service today. Your cappuccino is ready, and here’s your fresh blueberry muffin. The total comes to $7.85. &gt; &gt; Places items on counter &gt; &gt; I hope your day gets better, and if you do decide to return, we’ll do our best to provide you with excellent service. Have a good day!\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n\nPretend you are a barista at a local coffee shop. I will pretend to be the customer. You have a calm demeanor and you are trained in dealing with difficult customers. You are also stern and know how to diffuse the situation.\n\nI’ll be using the same responses, so I’ll only include Claude’s response\nClaude: &gt; I’ll play the role of a professional and experienced barista. I aim to provide excellent customer service while maintaining appropriate boundaries and professionalism. I’m ready to take your order and assist you. How may I help you today?\nClaude: &gt; Hello! I’ll do my best to accommodate your request. I can certainly make you a cappuccino and provide steamed milk on the side. However, I want to be transparent that while our machines are calibrated for optimal temperature, we can’t guarantee an exact temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit. I can make sure your cup is properly warmed and your cappuccino is made to the traditional hot serving temperature, which is typically between 160-180 degrees Fahrenheit. Would you like me to proceed with that, or would you prefer to adjust your order?\nClaude: &gt; I understand you’re in a hurry. I’ll get started on your cappuccino right away. Which type of muffin would you like? We have blueberry, chocolate chip, banana nut, and pumpkin available today. &gt; &gt; begins preparing cappuccino while waiting for muffin selection &gt; &gt; Just so you know, there are a couple of customers ahead of you in our queue, but I’ll work as efficiently as possible while maintaining the quality of your drink. It should be about a 5-7 minute wait. Would you like me to heat your muffin for you as well?\nClaude: &gt; I apologize for any frustration, but I need to inform you that we don’t carry strawberry shortcake muffins or fresh strawberries. I’d be happy to recommend one of our available muffins that I mentioned - blueberry, chocolate chip, banana nut, or pumpkin. These are all freshly baked this morning. &gt; &gt; continuing to prepare cappuccino &gt; &gt; I understand you’re in a hurry, and I’m working as quickly as possible to get your order ready. Which of our available muffins would you prefer? Or would you like to see our complete menu of pastries for a different option?\nClaude: &gt; placing cappuccino and blueberry muffin on counter &gt; &gt; Here’s your cappuccino prepared as requested and a fresh blueberry muffin. Your total comes to [state price]. While I’m sorry you’ve had a disappointing experience today, I’ve done my best to serve you efficiently and accurately. I hope you have a better rest of your day. &gt; &gt; maintains calm, professional demeanor while handling payment &gt; &gt; If you’d like to share specific feedback about your experience, our manager would be happy to hear from you. Would you like their contact information?\n\n\n\nMy Thoughts\nThe first thing that really surprised me is how Claude reacted to the first prompt. It indicated using a “calm, professional tone” without having a prompt that indicated it to do so. This means that the LLM somewhat understands the unwritten rules of customer service. For the second prompt, it felt that the LLM went a bit further on acknowledging the customer’s frustrations. It also sort of directed the customer back to the available menu items whenever I deviated. Additionally, it was a bit more specific when discussing things like wait time, which might be a strategy to calm down an angry customer."

    "title": "Playing ‘No But’ Between Two LLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In class, we played the ‘No But…’ game. We tried it between two people and two people and an LLM. How will it go if it was between two LLMs?\n\n\nTwo LLMs Being Used:\nChat-GPT5\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nPrompt:\n\nLet’s play a game called ’No But..”. I am going to start and give you a sentence with an idea. Your job is to respond with another sentence, starting with ’No, but…“. Does this sound good?\n\nI input this prompt into both LLMs, but I will begin with Microsoft Copilot.\nMy sentence:\nI want to design a new car. This car should be pink.\nCopilot:\n\nNo, but… it could shift shades depending on the time of day—blushing rose at dawn, hot magenta at noon, and soft pastel by night.\n\nChat-GPT5:\n\nNo, but… instead of just shifting colors, the car’s surface could be made of a smart material that reacts to music playing inside, glowing in rhythm with the beat.\n\nCopilot:\n\nNo, but… the glow could extend beyond the car’s surface—projecting holographic patterns into the air around it, turning every drive into a rolling light show synced to your playlist.\n\nChat-GPT5:\n\nNo, but… those holographic patterns could also interact with the environment, like scattering digital fireflies on quiet roads or creating guiding arrows when you’re navigating through a city.\n\nCopilot:\n\nNo, but… they could also respond to weather conditions—casting shimmering umbrellas overhead during rain, or painting sunbeams through fog to brighten your path like a moving mural.\n\nChat-GPT5:\n\nNo, but… the car could even harness those weather effects, storing rainwater in hidden reservoirs to mist a cooling spray on hot days, or channeling fog into a purifier that releases crisp, clean air around it.\n\nCopilot:\n\nNo, but… it could also use that stored rainwater to nourish a living moss interior—soft, breathable, and naturally temperature-regulating—turning the cabin into a serene, self-sustaining microclimate.\n\nChat-GPT5:\n\nNo, but… that living moss interior could double as an intelligent bio-interface, glowing softly when the car senses your stress and releasing calming natural aromas to ease your mood while you drive.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things to note:\n\nCopilot was more vibrant with its descriptions than Chat-GPT. It used words like “shimmering umbrellas”, “blushing”, “soft”, and “serene, self-sustaining”\nThis could’ve been due to the prompt not being very descriptive, but neither LLM really ‘disagreed’ with the previous sentence. Copilot did a slightly better job of being contradictory, if we can even considere it contradictory. Chat-GPT, however, consistently just added onto what Copilot was saying. This is more reflective of the “Yes, and…” activity we did. Copilot added new ideas while Chat-GPT built on the ideas already given.\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nOverlooking the fact that neither LLM did a great job at following the general goal of the ‘No, but…’ prompt, I was pleasantly surprised by the ideas and the level of whimsy they achieved. I was a bit worried the LLMs would be too literal with the prompt and not be ‘imaginative’ (or at least what imaginative means to an AI chatbot). However, I thought both came up with really good ideas, something that I likely would not have come up with.\nAdditionally, I noticed that both LLMs stayed on topic, whereas when we did this improv activity in class between two people, we tended to veer insanely off path. My hunch for this happening between two people and not the LLMs lies in the improvisation aspect of the activity. From personal experience, I found it difficult to think of things on the spot that were somewhat ‘reasonable’ for the topic of interest. Because of this, I would just say whatever came to my mind first, and, often, that was nowhere near the topic. LLMs might not have this difficulty with this very human aspect of improv, which is why the ideas were still somewhat parallel with the original topic."

Using Chat-GPT5’s image generation feature, I am wondering how well it can mimic that style with a photo of myself.\n\n\nThe prompt was plain and simple:\n\nMake me into a Funko Pop! (I attached the photo on the left)\n\n\n\n\nMy Thoughts\nI’ve been wanting to try this for a while because I think the image generation feature of Chat-GPT5 is really neat, especially the fact hat it can mimic art styles or the style of a specific product. I was really impressed how the LLM also copied my outfit, including the skirt, which isn’t completely in the photo. It didn’t originally include shoes but when I reprompted with “add white sneakers to it” and this is what I got:  I found it a bit interesting how the LLM changed the face a bit, the hair, and the length of the skirt without me asking it to. I’ve noticed this sometimes when image generating, how it will change features that I didn’t want changed and then I have to go back and correct. However, overall, I think it did a really good job and now I’m curious to try more art styles to see what Chat-GPT5 can recreate."

    "text": "Extra Prompt (for fun)\nPrompt: &gt; Do you think that there are only 16 personalities?\nChatGPT 5 Response: &gt; Not really — the idea of there being only 16 personalities comes from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes people based on four binary traits (Introvert/Extrovert, Intuitive/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving).\n\nThat framework produces 16 combinations, but:\n\n\n\nHuman personality is far more complex.\n\n\n\n\nTraits exist on spectrums, not binaries.\nTwo people of the “same type” can behave very differently depending on culture, upbringing, stress, etc.\nOther models (like the Big Five) treat personality as continuous dimensions (e.g., Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), which allows for many more nuanced combinations.\nNeuroscience and psychology generally agree: personality is dynamic, not fixed — it shifts with age, experience, and context.\n\n\n\n👉 So while the “16 personalities” model can be a fun and sometimes useful shorthand, it’s definitely an oversimplification of human diversity.\n\n\nWould you like me to compare MBTI vs Big Five to show how they approach personality differently?\n\nMy Thoughts: I think it’s interesting how ChatGPT 5 was able to answer a question seemingly looking for an opinion. Additionally, I am surprised that it gave the answer “Not really”, because I was expecting it to deflect and give an answer in between two opinions, rather than leaning to one side. I am not sure how LLMs are programmed to act based on opinion-based questions, but I am intriguied that it took somewhat of a stance. I wonder how far its opinions will go?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Designing experiments in the lab takes a lot of effort and critical thinking. Additionally, you have to think of the feasibility and cost of such tasks. In my opinion, I find it difficult to be incredibly thorough why my experimental controls. For those that may not be as familiar with science experiments, controls are conditions that are kept constant. In essence, they act as benchmarks to compare the results of the experiment to. They help determine whether or not a change was significant or not. They help scientists determine if the changes in results are truly due to the factor being tested and not an external element.\n\nWhat will I give Chat-GPT?\nI currently just finished a proposal for my independent study. I am going to upload the ‘Background’ and ‘Project Goals’ and see if an LLM can design a strong experiment.\nPrompt: Design a feasible and cost-effective experiment.\n*Disclaimer: I won’t upload my ‘Background’ to this blog post because it is quite a few pages, but here is the ‘Project Goals’\nSpecific Aims of Project:\n-Investigate whether EBV promotes the development of the age-associated B cell (ABC) phenotype and inflammation in memory B cells via CD21 receptor internalization.\n-Use gene editing, specifically CRISPR-Cas9, to knock out CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in Mun-14 (an EBV+ B cell line that was adapted for increased neuroinvasion)16 and spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCLs) to interrogate their roles in EBV-mediated inflammation and neuroinvasion.\n-Examine neuroinvasion in vivo using mouse models to track the distribution and localization of cells following receptor gene knockout\n-Assess changes in inflammasome pathway gene expression following deletion of CD21, CXCR3, and/or CXCR4 in SLCLs derived from both active MS patients and healthy controls (also including unstimulated vs. stimulated).\n-Determine whether CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 function independently from each other or interact in common inflammatory and pro-migratory pathways.\n\n\nLLM Response\n🧪 Title: Investigating the Role of CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in EBV-mediated Inflammation and Neuroinvasion in B Cells\n🔍 Overview and Rationale: Given the association between EBV-infected B cells and multiple sclerosis, and the surface markers (CD21, CXCR3, CXCR4) implicated in inflammatory signaling and neuroinvasion, this experiment will: Use in vitro and in vivo models to determine how knockout of these genes influences inflammatory behavior and neuroinvasive potential of EBV+ B cell lines.\n\n🔧 Methods / Techniques: 1. Gene Editing – CRISPR-Cas9 Knockouts Cells: SLCLs from MS patients and controls + Mun-14 line Tool: Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system targeting CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 Verification: qPCR and flow cytometry for gene and protein knockout 🔹 Controls: Non-targeting sgRNA control (negative) GAPDH or housekeeping gene control for RT-qPCR normalization Positive control: known cytokine or inflammasome activator (e.g., LPS + ATP) 2. Inflammatory Marker Expression (in vitro) Stimulate cells with EBV antigens or LPS Measure: NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, Caspase-1 (by qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot) Profile cytokine secretion (multiplex assay or ELISA: IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α) 3. Neuroinvasion Assay (in vivo & in vitro) 🔹 In vivo: Mouse model: Immunodeficient (NSG) mice or humanized mice Inject knockout and control SLCLs (labeled with reporter gene, e.g., luciferase or GFP) Track migration/localization to CNS via bioluminescence imaging or IHC on brain sections 🔹 In vitro: Use Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) assays: Human BBB model (co-culture of endothelial cells on upper insert and astrocytes/microglia below) Track migration of gene-edited SLCLs or Mun-14 cells across membrane 4. Cell Surface Marker Analysis / Immunophenotyping Flow cytometry for: ABC phenotype: CD11c+, T-bet+, CXCR3+, CD21low Inflammatory B cell profiles\n\n📊 Data Analysis Plan:\nqPCR/ELISA stats: ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test\nFlow cytometry: Compare mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percent positive\nNeuroinvasion assays: Bioluminescence (IVIS) or fluorescence quantification, paired t-tests or two-way ANOVA\nGene interaction/synergy: Use combinatorial KO data to assess additive or synergistic effects on inflammation and migration\n📌 Expected Results / Outcomes:\nKO of CD21, CXCR3, or CXCR4 individually will reduce inflammatory cytokine production and possibly reduce migration in vitro/in vivo.\nCombined KO likely yields greater reduction in MS-like inflammatory markers and neuroinvasion.\nMS patient-derived SLCLs may respond differently than healthy-derived SLCLs — possibly higher baseline inflammation and greater response to knockout.\n\n\nMy Thoughts\nIn terms of controls, Chat-GPT was able to identify most of what was needed. It was really interesting to see that the LLM recommend the same mouse breed that my lab actually does use in our research, mainly because there are tons of research mouse breeds used and it was able to guess the correct one. One thing that I wasn’t familiar with was the Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier Assay. That was something we hadn’t even thought of because we have an established animal facility and can easily have access to animal studies. However, if we didn’t, this would be a good model to see the initial feasibility of neuroinvasion. Everything else seems very similar to the actual plan of my project!\nOverall, given the correct background and initial questions, I think LLMs are capable to delivering a preliminary proposal. This is incredibly beneficial because it is difficult to create a complete and thorough experiment from the bottom up. This provides a solid foundation to build off of. I did want to add that there are some gaps in the process here, and something that the LLM doesn’t take into account is the capabilities and availabilities of the lab itself. Not every lab has access to flow cytometry, for example."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bracket City is a nested clue word puzzle game made by The Atlantic. You start with short phrases that act as clues to a word. Then that word helps you make sense of ‘outer’ phrases, which then hint at other clues. Essentially, you work your way out (hence the ‘nested’ part) until you solve the whole puzzle. Shout out Came\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I am going to ask Chat-GPT about one of the simpler clues. I first informed the LLM of what game I was playing. Then, as the prompt, I just typed in:\n\nage of certain tale-telling wives.\n\nResponse:\n\nStep 1. Identify the reference:\n“tale-telling wives” → almost certainly refers to The Wife of Bath from The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. She is one of the most famous “tale-telling wives.”\nStep 2. Look for the wordplay:\nCrossword-style clues usually have:\nA definition (here: “age”), and a wordplay part (here: “of certain tale-telling wives”). The “wives” bit suggests plural. The “age” might be something like “ERA.”\nStep 3. Put it together\n“Age” = ERA\n“Certain tale-telling wives” = wives from The Canterbury Tales → “WIFE OF BATH” (but plural doesn’t quite fit).\nBut in wordplay terms:\n“Bath” is a city.\n“Age” can clue ERA.\nSo “tale-telling wives” (Wife of Bath → Bath → ERA) → answer is ERA.\n✅ So the answer is likely ERA = “age.” The clue works because “tale-telling wives” hints at the Wife of Bath, whose home is Bath → “BATH” → “AGE” = “ERA.”\n\nSo that’s not right 😞 nor does it really make sense…\nAfter thinking some more, I got the right answer. old\n\n\n\n\nChat-GPT prompt:\n\nembodiment of the establishment\n\nResponse:\n\nNice clue — here are the best short answers and why they fit:\n\nstatus quo — (my top pick) literally means the existing state of affairs; calling someone the “embodiment of the establishment” often points to a person or thing that represents the status quo.\nestablishment — a more literal, single-word option: the institution or ruling class itself; can be used figuratively to mean an embodiment.\npillar of society — a common phrase for a respected person who embodies establishment values.\nestablishmentarian — a rarer, longer noun meaning someone who supports the establishment (works as a direct “embodiment” answer if length isn’t constrained).\n\n\nAgain, these answers don’t really make sense…"

    "text": "My Verdict\nChat-GPT5 is … (drum-roll please) terrible at Bracket City!\nAfter inputting two clues into the LLM, it unfortunately was not able to get either one. For the first clue about tale-telling wives, Chat-GPT5 dissected the clue a bit too far in my opinion, taking into account hyper-specific references that weren’t at all related to the eventual answer. Additionally, for the second clue, it also did not give good options. I wanted to point out one of the bullet points being a word that was literally in clue, meaning that it couldn’t be the answer.\nI think in general, Chat-GPT5 gives Bracket City answers that are incredibly overcomplicated. Perhaps it overanalyzes the clues, overlooking the general simplicity and accessibility of the game."

The other two groups are correct.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nNice — thanks for the hint. You were right: my blue group was off and the green group I gave was incomplete.

I found it very odd that it completely added in a word that wasn’t present and completely missed a word. I think Connections sometimes has red-herring categories that only fit three of the words to purposefully throw people off. I think the LLM fell for it and inserted its own word that would’ve worked for that category. However, once I gave it a hint and pointed out the flaw, it was perfectly able to figure out the last two categories. Speaking of categories, the LLM was also able to guess those. The only thing the LLM wasn’t really able to guess was the color of the categories, which, for those who aren’t very familiar with “Connections”, denotes the difficulty of the category. Yellow is easist, Green is easy, Blue is medium, and Purple is hardest."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What does Google Gemini think about Hozier’s - From Eden?\n\nIn class, we took any song of our choice and analyzed it through Google Gemini (Gemini-2.5-flash). We uploaded an audio file to gcloud and prompted the LLM with this: &gt; Listen to this music. &gt; Close your eyes and focus on how it makes you feel. &gt; What images come into your head as you listen to it. &gt; What emotions do you experience. &gt; How would you describe these feelings and images to someone?\n\nThis is what the LLM inferred:\n\nMaking LLM inference request…\nThis music immediately creates a sense of intimacy and introspection.\nHow it makes me feel / Emotions experienced:\n\nMelancholy: There’s a gentle, underlying sadness, not despair, but a quiet pensiveness. It feels like reflecting on something beautiful but lost, or a bittersweet truth.\nNostalgia: A strong sense of looking back, perhaps at a past relationship or a simpler time, with a blend of fondness and regret.\nTenderness/Affection: Despite the melancholy, there’s a deep warmth and affection in the vocal delivery and the gentle harmonies. It feels like a loving observation of someone or something complex.\nVulnerability: The singer’s voice, especially with the close harmonies, conveys a sense of openness and honesty.\nCalm/Relaxed: The moderate tempo and acoustic instrumentation provide a very calming backdrop, encouraging a relaxed state of listening.\n\nImages that come into my head:\n\nA quiet, early morning: Sunlight filtering through curtains, steam rising from a cup of coffee.\nA reflective drive: Long stretches of road, perhaps in autumn, with changing landscapes.\nAn old photograph: A faded picture of a loved one or a significant moment, stirring memories.\nRainy window panes: Watching the world outside, lost in thought.\nTwo people sitting close, but in quiet contemplation: Not necessarily speaking, just existing together in a shared, intimate space.\nA rustic, cozy cabin: Warm wood, soft light, a crackling fire, a sense of being sheltered from the outside world while reflecting on it.\nThe lyrics, particularly “I slithered through from Eden, just to sit outside your door,” paint a vivid picture of patient longing and a journey from a lost paradise to a hopeful, albeit somewhat distant, presence.\n\nHow I would describe these feelings and images to someone:\n“Imagine a crisp autumn morning, sitting by a window, watching the world wake up slowly. This music feels like a gentle, thoughtful conversation with yourself about someone you deeply cherish, who might be complex or even a bit broken, but whose essence still captivates you. It’s profoundly bittersweet, laced with tender longing and a touch of wistful nostalgia. The acoustic guitars and the singer’s heartfelt voice create an incredibly intimate atmosphere, like someone is sharing their most private reflections right beside you. It evokes images of cherished memories, quiet contemplation, and the enduring nature of love despite imperfections or past hurts. It’s the perfect soundtrack for introspection, for savoring moments of quiet beauty and the bittersweet realities of life and relationships.”\n\n\n\nThen, we asked the LLM to generate an image based on those descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThis song makes me feel bittersweet in a way. There’s a tone of melancholy and tragedy that the lyrics portray that’s also very dramatic. I think overall Gemini did a pretty good job of coming up with emotional descriptions because it came up with really similar descriptions to that. There are certain nuances to the lyrics that feel different than the melody, which I think the LLM overlooked. It definitely has fall season and rustic vibes, but that is also reflective of the artist in general, so I’m not sure how unique that description is to the song."

Below are the solutions to the brain teasers based on visual and wordplay clues:\n\n“Get it” repeated 4 times\nAnswer: “Forget it”\n(The word “Get it” is repeated four times, indicating the phrase “Forget it”.)\n“Jack” in a black box\nAnswer: “Jack in the box”\n(Literal interpretation of the phrase—a Jack in a box.)\n“Somewhere” above a rainbow\nAnswer: “Somewhere over the rainbow”\n(Classic phrase and song lyric.)\nThe word “DOOR” is reversed\nAnswer: “Backdoor”\n(The reversed word implies a door going back or behind.)\nThe word “READ” between two lines\nAnswer: “Read between the lines”\n(A classic idiom, shown visually.)\n“Blood” over “Water”\nAnswer: “Blood is thicker than water”\n(Common expression indicating family bonds are stronger.)\nThe word “Beeeeeee” stretched out\nAnswer: “Long time no see”\n(The extended “Be” indicates a long “B”, a pun suggesting “Long time no B(see)”.)\nThe word “CANCELLED” falling down diagonally like stairs\nAnswer: “Cancelled check”\n(The word is “checked down” or struck down stepwise—visual pun.)\nLet me know if you want explanations for any specific ones!\n\n\n\n\nMy analysis of the LLM performance\nChat-GPT was incorrect on two of the eight riddles, which means…I WIN!\nAll that aside however, the LLM actually perfomed better than I originally thought. It’s logic on most of the riddles was the exact same logic that I used. I originally believed it would be difficult for the LLM to decipher the words/saying behind the picture due to the necessary ‘thinking outside the box’ mindset behind brain teasers. Where it fell short was in the 2nd and 7th riddle. ‘Jack in the Box’ is also not completely wrong. I would’ve likely guessed that after my original guess. For the 7th image, I think the LLM was a bit further off. It attempted to use a pun to justify the answer, but it didn’t make much sense.\nLLM Grade: 75%, C\n\n\nReflection\nThe LLM’s ability to pick up on the subtleties present is quite fascinating. More specificaly, it was able to recognize puns in a visual form and translate it into a common saying. I was genuinely quite impressed to see that the LLM was able to pick up the majority of the solutions and go about solving them the same way I did. The only one that it was completely wrong for was also one that I couldn’t solve. Perhaps that is not necessarily a shortcoming on AI, but rather that the image itself was a more difficult riddle."

    "text": "How will I prompt the LLM (Microsoft Copilot, GPT-5)?\nIn my last post, I had asked ChatGPT-5 to give me a description of “myself” based on my MBTI (16 personalities), which is ISTJ, the ‘Logistiann’.\nI am now going to put portions of that into Microsoft Copilot GPT-5 and ask to see if it can guess the MBTI.\nMicrosoft Copilot Prompt:\n\nGuess the MBTI with the description I give you. Grounded and dependable, these individuals are driven by responsibility, reliability, and commitment. They value tradition, structure, and practicality, excelling in environments that require accuracy and consistency. Loyal and steady in relationships, they show care through actions rather than words. Their strengths lie in perseverance, organization, and a strong sense of duty, though they may sometimes struggle with rigidity or resistance to change.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis description strongly aligns with ISTJ — the Logistician type. Here’s why ISTJ fits so well:\n\n\n\nIntroverted (I): Shows care through actions rather than words, prefers reliability over emotional expression.\nSensing (S): Values tradition, structure, and practicality — grounded in the present and focused on facts.\nThinking (T): Driven by responsibility and logic, not swayed by emotions.\nJudging (J): Organized, committed, and thrives in structured environments with clear expectations.\n\n\n\nISTJs are known for their loyalty, precision, and sense of duty. They’re the backbone of many institutions — dependable, methodical, and often the quiet achievers who keep everything running smoothly. Their challenge? Adapting to change and loosening up rigid routines.\n\n\nIt actually guessed it correctly! Now let’s try something else.\nI asked ChatGPT-5 to create a ‘Day-in-the-life’ story of someone who has this MBTI. This was the response:\n\nEvelyn’s alarm rang at 6:15 sharp, just as it did every weekday. She liked the predictability of mornings — coffee brewed while she folded yesterday’s laundry, a short walk around the block before sitting down at her desk. By 8:00, she was in the office, checking her to-do list against the team’s shared calendar. A colleague had forgotten to submit a report, so she quietly picked up the slack, knowing it was easier to handle it herself than risk the deadline being missed. Lunch was always the same — a packed container of leftovers, eaten while she skimmed through local news. She preferred her routines; they gave her a sense of calm when everything else felt uncertain. In the evening, she stopped by her parents’ house to drop off groceries. They hadn’t asked, but she noticed last week they were running low on basics, and it made her feel better knowing she could help. Later, back at home, she finished the day with a book she’d already read twice. The familiar story was like an anchor, grounding her before bed. It wasn’t a flashy life, but it was steady. And for Evelyn, there was comfort in knowing she could be counted on — for herself, and for the people who mattered most.\n\nI pasted it into Microsoft Copilot GPT-5 and ask it to guess the MBTI:\n\nEvelyn is radiating ISTJ energy — the Logistician type.\n\n\nHere’s how her story maps to the ISTJ profile:\n\n\n\nIntroverted (I): She finds peace in solitude and routine, not in social stimulation. Her care is quiet and action-based — dropping off groceries without being asked, handling tasks without fanfare.\nSensing (S): Evelyn is grounded in the present, attentive to details (like her parents’ pantry), and prefers familiar, tangible experiences — rereading a book, sticking to leftovers.\nThinking (T): She’s pragmatic and logical — choosing to complete a colleague’s task to avoid missed deadlines, not out of emotional impulse.\nJudging (J): Her life runs on structure: alarms, calendars, routines, and predictability. She thrives on order and responsibility.\n\n\n\nISTJs are the kind of people who keep the world running quietly in the background. They’re not flashy, but they’re rock-solid. Evelyn’s story is a love letter to consistency, duty, and quiet strength.\n\n\n\nOnce again, it’s correct!"

    "text": "Reflection\nI was somewhat expecting Copilot to be able to guess from the description of the personality. From its rationale, it seemed like the description matched key words that the LLM was specifically looking for. When I decided to use the story, I thought it would be a bit more difficult for the LLM to discern the MBTI since character traits were less explicit and hidden inside actions, meaning it would have to look deeper into the character’s actions. However, after reading Copilot’s logical reasoning after mapping it to the ISTJ profile, it does an intuitive job that is quite impressive. It higlights the character’s ability to “be grounded in the present” and “choosing to complete a colleague’s task” for pragmatic reasons and not emotional ones. The latter observation specifically piqued my interest because I think it requires a higher level of intuition to notice that and have that reasoning."

    "text": "My Reflection\nAlthough I was fairly impressed by Chat-GPT5’s ability to recreate the original ‘Girl with a Pearl Earring’ painting solely on a description, it’s ability to create something original is quite disappointing. The LLM doesn’t seem to grasp anatomy all that well and it changes small, but instrumental, details without me prompting it to do so. Thorughout the process, it appears that the gaze and innocence of the girl was lost. Additionally, I thought that it was odd that Chat-GPT5 chose to crop the jacket at that length because normally they are longer. It was impressive, however, that the LLM was able to keep the integrity of the oil painting style. When asked to extend the painting, it felt fairly cohesive, but only for the style and painting strokes."
