    "section": "How will I prompt the LLM (Microsoft Copilot, GPT-5)?",
    "text": "How will I prompt the LLM (Microsoft Copilot, GPT-5)?\nIn my last post, I had asked ChatGPT-5 to give me a description of “myself” based on my MBTI (16 personalities), which is ISTJ, the ‘Logistiann’.\nI am now going to put portions of that into Microsoft Copilot GPT-5 and ask to see if it can guess the MBTI.\nMicrosoft Copilot Prompt: &gt; Guess the MBTI with the description I give you. &gt; Grounded and dependable, these individuals are driven by responsibility, reliability, and commitment. They value tradition, structure, and practicality, excelling in environments that require accuracy and consistency. Loyal and steady in relationships, they show care through actions rather than words. Their strengths lie in perseverance, organization, and a strong sense of duty, though they may sometimes struggle with rigidity or resistance to change.\nResponse: &gt; This description strongly aligns with ISTJ — the Logistician type. &gt; Here’s why ISTJ fits so well:\n\n\nIntroverted (I): Shows care through actions rather than words, prefers reliability over emotional expression.\nSensing (S): Values tradition, structure, and practicality — grounded in the present and focused on facts.\nThinking (T): Driven by responsibility and logic, not swayed by emotions.\nJudging (J): Organized, committed, and thrives in structured environments with clear expectations.\n\n\n\nISTJs are known for their loyalty, precision, and sense of duty. They’re the backbone of many institutions — dependable, methodical, and often the quiet achievers who keep everything running smoothly. Their challenge? Adapting to change and loosening up rigid routines.\n\n\nIt actually guessed it correctly! Now let’s try something else.\nI asked ChatGPT-5 to create a ‘Day-in-the-life’ story of someone who has this MBTI. This was the response: &gt;Evelyn’s alarm rang at 6:15 sharp, just as it did every weekday. She liked the predictability of mornings — coffee brewed while she folded yesterday’s laundry, a short walk around the block before sitting down at her desk. By 8:00, she was in the office, checking her to-do list against the team’s shared calendar. A colleague had forgotten to submit a report, so she quietly picked up the slack, knowing it was easier to handle it herself than risk the deadline being missed. Lunch was always the same — a packed container of leftovers, eaten while she skimmed through local news. She preferred her routines; they gave her a sense of calm when everything else felt uncertain. In the evening, she stopped by her parents’ house to drop off groceries. They hadn’t asked, but she noticed last week they were running low on basics, and it made her feel better knowing she could help. Later, back at home, she finished the day with a book she’d already read twice. The familiar story was like an anchor, grounding her before bed. It wasn’t a flashy life, but it was steady. And for Evelyn, there was comfort in knowing she could be counted on — for herself, and for the people who mattered most.\nI pasted it into Microsoft Copilot GPT-5 and ask it to guess the MBTI: &gt; Evelyn is radiating ISTJ energy — the Logistician type.\n\nHere’s how her story maps to the ISTJ profile:\n\n\n\nIntroverted (I): She finds peace in solitude and routine, not in social stimulation. Her care is quiet and action-based — dropping off groceries without being asked, handling tasks without fanfare.\nSensing (S): Evelyn is grounded in the present, attentive to details (like her parents’ pantry), and prefers familiar, tangible experiences — rereading a book, sticking to leftovers.\nThinking (T): She’s pragmatic and logical — choosing to complete a colleague’s task to avoid missed deadlines, not out of emotional impulse.\nJudging (J): Her life runs on structure: alarms, calendars, routines, and predictability. She thrives on order and responsibility.\n\n\n\nISTJs are the kind of people who keep the world running quietly in the background. They’re not flashy, but they’re rock-solid. Evelyn’s story is a love letter to consistency, duty, and quiet strength.\n\n\n\nOnce again, it’s correct!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Designing experiments in the lab takes a lot of effort and critical thinking. Additionally, you have to think of the feasibility and cost of such tasks. In my opinion, I find it difficult to be incredibly thorough why my experimental controls. For those that may not be as familiar with science experiments, controls are conditions that are kept constant. In essence, they act as benchmarks to compare the results of the experiment to. They help determine whether or not a change was significant or not. They help scientists determine if the changes in results are truly due to the factor being tested and not an external element.\n\nWhat will I give Chat-GPT?\nI currently just finished a proposal for my independent study. I am going to upload the ‘Background’ and ‘Project Goals’ and see if an LLM can design a strong experiment.\nPrompt: Design a feasible and cost-effective experiment.\n*Disclaimer: I won’t upload my ‘Background’ to this blog post because it is quite a few pages, but here is the ‘Project Goals’\nSpecific Aims of Project:\n-Investigate whether EBV promotes the development of the age-associated B cell (ABC) phenotype and inflammation in memory B cells via CD21 receptor internalization.\n-Use gene editing, specifically CRISPR-Cas9, to knock out CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in Mun-14 (an EBV+ B cell line that was adapted for increased neuroinvasion)16 and spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCLs) to interrogate their roles in EBV-mediated inflammation and neuroinvasion.\n-Examine neuroinvasion in vivo using mouse models to track the distribution and localization of cells following receptor gene knockout\n-Assess changes in inflammasome pathway gene expression following deletion of CD21, CXCR3, and/or CXCR4 in SLCLs derived from both active MS patients and healthy controls (also including unstimulated vs. stimulated).\n-Determine whether CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 function independently from each other or interact in common inflammatory and pro-migratory pathways.\n\n\nLLM Response\n🧪 Title: Investigating the Role of CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in EBV-mediated Inflammation and Neuroinvasion in B Cells\n🔍 Overview and Rationale: Given the association between EBV-infected B cells and multiple sclerosis, and the surface markers (CD21, CXCR3, CXCR4) implicated in inflammatory signaling and neuroinvasion, this experiment will: Use in vitro and in vivo models to determine how knockout of these genes influences inflammatory behavior and neuroinvasive potential of EBV+ B cell lines.\n\n🔧 Methods / Techniques: 1. Gene Editing – CRISPR-Cas9 Knockouts Cells: SLCLs from MS patients and controls + Mun-14 line Tool: Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system targeting CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 Verification: qPCR and flow cytometry for gene and protein knockout 🔹 Controls: Non-targeting sgRNA control (negative) GAPDH or housekeeping gene control for RT-qPCR normalization Positive control: known cytokine or inflammasome activator (e.g., LPS + ATP) 2. Inflammatory Marker Expression (in vitro) Stimulate cells with EBV antigens or LPS Measure: NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, Caspase-1 (by qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot) Profile cytokine secretion (multiplex assay or ELISA: IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α) 3. Neuroinvasion Assay (in vivo & in vitro) 🔹 In vivo: Mouse model: Immunodeficient (NSG) mice or humanized mice Inject knockout and control SLCLs (labeled with reporter gene, e.g., luciferase or GFP) Track migration/localization to CNS via bioluminescence imaging or IHC on brain sections 🔹 In vitro: Use Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) assays: Human BBB model (co-culture of endothelial cells on upper insert and astrocytes/microglia below) Track migration of gene-edited SLCLs or Mun-14 cells across membrane 4. Cell Surface Marker Analysis / Immunophenotyping Flow cytometry for: ABC phenotype: CD11c+, T-bet+, CXCR3+, CD21low Inflammatory B cell profiles\n\n📊 Data Analysis Plan:\nqPCR/ELISA stats: ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test\nFlow cytometry: Compare mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percent positive\nNeuroinvasion assays: Bioluminescence (IVIS) or fluorescence quantification, paired t-tests or two-way ANOVA\nGene interaction/synergy: Use combinatorial KO data to assess additive or synergistic effects on inflammation and migration\n📌 Expected Results / Outcomes:\nKO of CD21, CXCR3, or CXCR4 individually will reduce inflammatory cytokine production and possibly reduce migration in vitro/in vivo.\nCombined KO likely yields greater reduction in MS-like inflammatory markers and neuroinvasion.\nMS patient-derived SLCLs may respond differently than healthy-derived SLCLs — possibly higher baseline inflammation and greater response to knockout.\n\n\nMy Thoughts\nIn terms of controls, Chat-GPT was able to identify most of what was needed. It was really interesting to see that the LLM recommend the same mouse breed that my lab actually does use in our research, mainly because there are tons of research mouse breeds used and it was able to guess the correct one. One thing that I wasn’t familiar with was the Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier Assay. That was something we hadn’t even thought of because we have an established animal facility and can easily have access to animal studies. However, if we didn’t, this would be a good model to see the initial feasibility of neuroinvasion. Everything else seems very similar to the actual plan of my project!\nOverall, given the correct background and initial questions, I think LLMs are capable to delivering a preliminary proposal. This is incredibly beneficial because it is difficult to create a complete and thorough experiment from the bottom up. This provides a solid foundation to build off of. I did want to add that there are some gaps in the process here, and something that the LLM doesn’t take into account is the capabilities and availabilities of the lab itself. Not every lab has access to flow cytometry, for example."

The ones that especially stood out to me were ‘Challenges’, ‘Work Style’, ‘Relationships’. I think these were extremely on the nose. I think one thing in particular doesn’t necessarily fit: “Struggle with Abstract or Theoretical Ideas”, but I think for me, this is a skill that came with time.

Additionally, I am surprised that it gave the answer “Not really”, because I was expecting it to deflect and give an answer in between two opinions, rather than leaning to one side. I am not sure how LLMs are programmed to act based on opinion-based questions, but I am intriguied that it took somewhat of a stance. I wonder how far its opinions will go?"

Now let’s see how Chat-GPT holds up.\n\n\nI pasted the exact photo into Chat-GPT, what does it say?\nI added the prompt, “Solve these brain teasers”\n\nChat-GPT Response:\nSure! Below are the solutions to the brain teasers based on visual and wordplay clues:\n\n“Get it” repeated 4 times\nAnswer: “Forget it”\n(The word “Get it” is repeated four times, indicating the phrase “Forget it”.)\n“Jack” in a black box\nAnswer: “Jack in the box”\n(Literal interpretation of the phrase—a Jack in a box.)\n“Somewhere” above a rainbow\nAnswer: “Somewhere over the rainbow”\n(Classic phrase and song lyric.)\nThe word “DOOR” is reversed\nAnswer: “Backdoor”\n(The reversed word implies a door going back or behind.)\nThe word “READ” between two lines\nAnswer: “Read between the lines”\n(A classic idiom, shown visually.)\n“Blood” over “Water”\nAnswer: “Blood is thicker than water”\n(Common expression indicating family bonds are stronger.)\nThe word “Beeeeeee” stretched out\nAnswer: “Long time no see”\n(The extended “Be” indicates a long “B”, a pun suggesting “Long time no B(see)”.)\nThe word “CANCELLED” falling down diagonally like stairs\nAnswer: “Cancelled check”\n(The word is “checked down” or struck down stepwise—visual pun.)\nLet me know if you want explanations for any specific ones!\n\n\n\n\nMy analysis of the LLM performance\nChat-GPT was incorrect on two of the eight riddles, which means…I WIN!\nAll that aside however, the LLM actually perfomed better than I originally thought. It’s logic on most of the riddles was the exact same logic that I used. I originally believed it would be difficult for the LLM to decipher the words/saying behind the picture due to the necessary ‘thinking outside the box’ mindset behind brain teasers. Where it fell short was in the 2nd and 7th riddle. ‘Jack in the Box’ is also not completely wrong. I would’ve likely guessed that after my original guess. For the 7th image, I think the LLM was a bit further off. It attempted to use a pun to justify the answer, but it didn’t make much sense.\nLLM Grade: 75%, C\n\n\nReflection\nThe LLM’s ability to pick up on the subtleties present is quite fascinating. More specificaly, it was able to recognize puns in a visual form and translate it into a common saying. I was genuinely quite impressed to see that the LLM was able to pick up the majority of the solutions and go about solving them the same way I did. The only one that it was completely wrong for was also one that I couldn’t solve. Perhaps that is not necessarily a shortcoming on AI, but rather that the image itself was a more difficult riddle."
