    "section": "",
    "text": "Designing experiments in the lab takes a lot of effort and critical thinking. Additionally, you have to think of the feasibility and cost of such tasks. In my opinion, I find it difficult to be incredibly thorough why my experimental controls. For those that may not be as familiar with science experiments, controls are conditions that are kept constant. In essence, they act as benchmarks to compare the results of the experiment to. They help determine whether or not a change was significant or not. They help scientists determine if the changes in results are truly due to the factor being tested and not an external element.\n\nWhat will I give Chat-GPT?\nI currently just finished a proposal for my independent study. I am going to upload the ‚ÄòBackground‚Äô and ‚ÄòProject Goals‚Äô and see if an LLM can design a strong experiment.\nPrompt: Design a feasible and cost-effective experiment.\n*Disclaimer: I won‚Äôt upload my ‚ÄòBackground‚Äô to this blog post because it is quite a few pages, but here is the ‚ÄòProject Goals‚Äô\nSpecific Aims of Project:\n-Investigate whether EBV promotes the development of the age-associated B cell (ABC) phenotype and inflammation in memory B cells via CD21 receptor internalization.\n-Use gene editing, specifically CRISPR-Cas9, to knock out CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in Mun-14 (an EBV+ B cell line that was adapted for increased neuroinvasion)16 and spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCLs) to interrogate their roles in EBV-mediated inflammation and neuroinvasion.\n-Examine neuroinvasion in vivo using mouse models to track the distribution and localization of cells following receptor gene knockout\n-Assess changes in inflammasome pathway gene expression following deletion of CD21, CXCR3, and/or CXCR4 in SLCLs derived from both active MS patients and healthy controls (also including unstimulated vs.¬†stimulated).\n-Determine whether CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 function independently from each other or interact in common inflammatory and pro-migratory pathways.\n\n\nLLM Response\nüß™ Title: Investigating the Role of CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in EBV-mediated Inflammation and Neuroinvasion in B Cells\nüîç Overview and Rationale: Given the association between EBV-infected B cells and multiple sclerosis, and the surface markers (CD21, CXCR3, CXCR4) implicated in inflammatory signaling and neuroinvasion, this experiment will: Use in vitro and in vivo models to determine how knockout of these genes influences inflammatory behavior and neuroinvasive potential of EBV+ B cell lines.\n\nüîß Methods / Techniques: 1. Gene Editing ‚Äì CRISPR-Cas9 Knockouts Cells: SLCLs from MS patients and controls + Mun-14 line Tool: Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system targeting CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 Verification: qPCR and flow cytometry for gene and protein knockout üîπ Controls: Non-targeting sgRNA control (negative) GAPDH or housekeeping gene control for RT-qPCR normalization Positive control: known cytokine or inflammasome activator (e.g., LPS + ATP) 2. Inflammatory Marker Expression (in vitro) Stimulate cells with EBV antigens or LPS Measure: NLRP3, IL-1Œ≤, IL-18, Caspase-1 (by qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot) Profile cytokine secretion (multiplex assay or ELISA: IFN-Œ≥, IL-6, TNF-Œ±) 3. Neuroinvasion Assay (in vivo & in vitro) üîπ In vivo: Mouse model: Immunodeficient (NSG) mice or humanized mice Inject knockout and control SLCLs (labeled with reporter gene, e.g., luciferase or GFP) Track migration/localization to CNS via bioluminescence imaging or IHC on brain sections üîπ In vitro: Use Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) assays: Human BBB model (co-culture of endothelial cells on upper insert and astrocytes/microglia below) Track migration of gene-edited SLCLs or Mun-14 cells across membrane 4. Cell Surface Marker Analysis / Immunophenotyping Flow cytometry for: ABC phenotype: CD11c+, T-bet+, CXCR3+, CD21low Inflammatory B cell profiles\n\nüìä Data Analysis Plan:\nqPCR/ELISA stats: ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test\nFlow cytometry: Compare mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percent positive\nNeuroinvasion assays: Bioluminescence (IVIS) or fluorescence quantification, paired t-tests or two-way ANOVA\nGene interaction/synergy: Use combinatorial KO data to assess additive or synergistic effects on inflammation and migration\nüìå Expected Results / Outcomes:\nKO of CD21, CXCR3, or CXCR4 individually will reduce inflammatory cytokine production and possibly reduce migration in vitro/in vivo.\nCombined KO likely yields greater reduction in MS-like inflammatory markers and neuroinvasion.\nMS patient-derived SLCLs may respond differently than healthy-derived SLCLs ‚Äî possibly higher baseline inflammation and greater response to knockout.\n\n\nMy Thoughts"

    "text": "Back in 4th grade, my teacher would have us do brain teasers every day during lunch. She would write them down and project them onto the white board. There was no reward, no prize, just bragging rights. From this, I was inspired to see if LLM‚Äôs were any better than I was at 10 years old. Does Chat-GPT have the ability to guess a word or saying based on a very literal picture? Let‚Äôs find out!\n\n\nLet‚Äôs see if I can figure out these eight teasers\n\nForget it (4 Get It)\nBlackjack?\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBack door?\nRead between the lines\nBlood is thicker than water\n???\nCancelled check\n\nThe only one I missed was number 7, which was ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù. Out of eight, I missed one of them, which honestly isn‚Äôt bad. Now let‚Äôs see how Chat-GPT holds up.\n\n\nI pasted the exact photo into Chat-GPT, what does it say?\nI added the prompt, ‚ÄúSolve these brain teasers‚Äù\n\nChat-GPT Response:\nSure! Below are the solutions to the brain teasers based on visual and wordplay clues:\n\n‚ÄúGet it‚Äù repeated 4 times\nAnswer: ‚ÄúForget it‚Äù\n(The word ‚ÄúGet it‚Äù is repeated four times, indicating the phrase ‚ÄúForget it‚Äù.)\n‚ÄúJack‚Äù in a black box\nAnswer: ‚ÄúJack in the box‚Äù\n(Literal interpretation of the phrase‚Äîa Jack in a box.)\n‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù above a rainbow\nAnswer: ‚ÄúSomewhere over the rainbow‚Äù\n(Classic phrase and song lyric.)\nThe word ‚ÄúDOOR‚Äù is reversed\nAnswer: ‚ÄúBackdoor‚Äù\n(The reversed word implies a door going back or behind.)\nThe word ‚ÄúREAD‚Äù between two lines\nAnswer: ‚ÄúRead between the lines‚Äù\n(A classic idiom, shown visually.)\n‚ÄúBlood‚Äù over ‚ÄúWater‚Äù\nAnswer: ‚ÄúBlood is thicker than water‚Äù\n(Common expression indicating family bonds are stronger.)\nThe word ‚ÄúBeeeeeee‚Äù stretched out\nAnswer: ‚ÄúLong time no see‚Äù\n(The extended ‚ÄúBe‚Äù indicates a long ‚ÄúB‚Äù, a pun suggesting ‚ÄúLong time no B(see)‚Äù.)\nThe word ‚ÄúCANCELLED‚Äù falling down diagonally like stairs\nAnswer: ‚ÄúCancelled check‚Äù\n(The word is ‚Äúchecked down‚Äù or struck down stepwise‚Äîvisual pun.)\nLet me know if you want explanations for any specific ones!\n\n\n\n\nMy analysis of the LLM performance\nChat-GPT was incorrect on two of the eight riddles, which means‚Ä¶I WIN!\nAll that aside however, the LLM actually perfomed better than I originally thought. It‚Äôs logic on most of the riddles was the exact same logic that I used. I originally believed it would be difficult for the LLM to decipher the words/saying behind the picture due to the necessary ‚Äòthinking outside the box‚Äô mindset behind brain teasers. Where it fell short was in the 2nd and 7th riddle. ‚ÄòJack in the Box‚Äô is also not completely wrong. I would‚Äôve likely guessed that after my original guess. For the 7th image, I think the LLM was a bit further off. It attempted to use a pun to justify the answer, but it didn‚Äôt make much sense.\nLLM Grade: 75%, C\n\n\nReflection\nThe LLM‚Äôs ability to pick up on the subtleties present is quite fascinating. More specificaly, it was able to recognize puns in a visual form and translate it into a common saying. I was genuinely quite impressed to see that the LLM was able to pick up the majority of the solutions and go about solving them the same way I did. The only one that it was completely wrong for was also one that I couldn‚Äôt solve. Perhaps that is not necessarily a shortcoming on AI, but rather that the image itself was a more difficult riddle."
