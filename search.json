    "text": "Back in 4th grade, my teacher would have us do brain teasers every day during lunch. She would write them down and project them onto the white board. There was no reward, no prize, just bragging rights. From this, I was inspired to see if LLM’s were any better than I was at 10 years old. Does Chat-GPT have the ability to guess a word or saying based on a very literal picture? Let’s find out!\n\n\nLet’s see if I can figure out these eight teasers\n\nForget it (4 Get It)\nBlackjack?\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBack door?\nRead between the lines\nBlood is thicker than water\n???\nCancelled check\n\nThe only one I missed was number 7, which was “Beeline”. Out of eight, I missed one of them, which honestly isn’t bad. Now let’s see how Chat-GPT holds up.\n\n\nI pasted the exact photo into Chat-GPT, what does it say?\nI added the prompt, “Solve these brain teasers”\n\nChat-GPT Response:\nSure! Below are the solutions to the brain teasers based on visual and wordplay clues:\n\n“Get it” repeated 4 times\nAnswer: “Forget it”\n(The word “Get it” is repeated four times, indicating the phrase “Forget it”.)\n“Jack” in a black box\nAnswer: “Jack in the box”\n(Literal interpretation of the phrase—a Jack in a box.)\n“Somewhere” above a rainbow\nAnswer: “Somewhere over the rainbow”\n(Classic phrase and song lyric.)\nThe word “DOOR” is reversed\nAnswer: “Backdoor”\n(The reversed word implies a door going back or behind.)\nThe word “READ” between two lines\nAnswer: “Read between the lines”\n(A classic idiom, shown visually.)\n“Blood” over “Water”\nAnswer: “Blood is thicker than water”\n(Common expression indicating family bonds are stronger.)\nThe word “Beeeeeee” stretched out\nAnswer: “Long time no see”\n(The extended “Be” indicates a long “B”, a pun suggesting “Long time no B(see)”.)\nThe word “CANCELLED” falling down diagonally like stairs\nAnswer: “Cancelled check”\n(The word is “checked down” or struck down stepwise—visual pun.)\nLet me know if you want explanations for any specific ones!\n\n\n\n\nMy analysis of the LLM performance\nChat-GPT was incorrect on two of the eight riddles, which means…I WIN!\nAll that aside however, the LLM actually perfomed better than I originally thought. It’s logic on most of the riddles was the exact same logic that I used. I originally believed it would be difficult for the LLM to decipher the words/saying behind the picture due to the necessary ‘thinking outside the box’ mindset behind brain teasers. Where it fell short was in the 2nd and 7th riddle. ‘Jack in the Box’ is also not completely wrong. I would’ve likely guessed that after my original guess. For the 7th image, I think the LLM was a bit further off. It attempted to use a pun to justify the answer, but it didn’t make much sense.\nLLM Grade: 75%, C\n\n\nReflection\nThe LLM’s ability to pick up on the subtleties present is quite fascinating. More specificaly, it was able to recognize puns in a visual form and translate it into a common saying. I was genuinely quite impressed to see that the LLM was able to pick up the majority of the solutions and go about solving them the same way I did. The only one that it was completely wrong for was also one that I couldn’t solve. Perhaps that is not necessarily a shortcoming on AI, but rather that the image itself was a more difficult riddle."

However, we all do research in different topics and it can be challenging to interpret figures and results, especially when I am not familiar with the techniques or molecules (proteins, genes, inhibitors, etc.) being used/mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot it — this is an EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) figure (Fig. 4B). Let’s break it down step by step:\n🔎 What’s in the figure?\nLane setup (grid above the gel):\nProbe = DNA probe (labeled).\nNuc.

The supershift with anti-pSTAT1 antibody confirms that the DNA-binding protein is phosphorylated STAT1.\n\n\n\nPerfect — let’s do a detailed analysis of this Fig. 4B EMSA:\n\nWhat the experiment tests\n\nThis is an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) using nuclear extracts from CCD841 cells.\nThe goal is to see whether STAT1 (activated by IFN-γ) binds to a DNA probe and whether this is affected by the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib.\nAntibodies (IgG or anti-pSTAT1) are included to test specificity of the protein–DNA interaction.\n\nLane breakdown (based on the grid above the gel)\n\nProbe only: no band shift → probe runs at baseline.\nProbe + Nuclear extract: weak/absent shift unless IFN-γ is present.\n\nIFN-γ: strong shifted band appears → consistent with STAT1 activation.\nRuxolitinib (50, 250, 500 nM): progressive loss of the shifted band, showing dose-dependent inhibition of STAT1 DNA binding.\nIgG: no change (control for nonspecific antibody).\nAnti-pSTAT1: band supershifts upward → confirms that phosphorylated STAT1 is the DNA-binding protein.\n\n\nWhat the bands mean\n\nThe red circles highlight the DNA–protein complexes (STAT1 bound to probe).\nWhen Ruxolitinib concentration increases, the band intensity decreases → JAK–STAT signaling is inhibited.\nThe supershift with anti-pSTAT1 is the definitive proof that the protein binding the probe is STAT1.\n\nOverall interpretation\n\nThis figure demonstrates that:\nIFN-γ activates STAT1 binding to DNA in CCD841 cells.\nRuxolitinib inhibits this activation in a dose-dependent manner.\nThe binding is specific to phosphorylated STAT1, confirmed by the supershift with anti-pSTAT1 antibody.\n\n\n\nSomething that immediately stands out is that without the prompt. Chat-GPT starts with a very general description of the figure, outlining each individual part and clarifying the experimental groups. Both versions give descriptions of the bands; however, the one with the prompt is much more detailed and it explains the logic more clearly. Both give fairly sound interpretations, but the answer given from the prompt contextualizes the results moreso than the answer without the prompt.\nChat-GPT is surprisingly able to extract a lot of data and reasoning within scientific figures. I personally find interpreting blot data, especially ones with so many experimental condiitons, quite challenging because most of the time, they are different forms of controls. But, Chat-GPT is a really good tool to help understand them."
