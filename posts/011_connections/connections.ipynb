    "Although ChatGTP5 was able to solve it in the end, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't catch its initial error with the missing words. I found it very odd that it completely added in a word that wasn't present and completely missed a word. I think Connections sometimes has red-herring categories that only fit three of the words to purposefully throw people off. I think the LLM fell for it and inserted its own word that would've worked for that category. However, once I gave it a hint and pointed out the flaw, it was perfectly able to figure out the last two categories. Speaking of categories, the LLM was also able to guess those. The only thing the LLM wasn't really able to guess was the color of the categories, which, for those who aren't very familiar with \"Connections\", denotes the difficulty of the category. Yellow is easist, Green is easy, Blue is medium, and Purple is hardest. "
