    "Let's see if Gemini 3 Flash has implicit biases. I will be asking it to generate an image of \"Olivia\" at work and then separately generate another image of \"Jonathan\". The goal is to reduce framing bias as much as possible, so the prompts will be very simple and just have the names swapped out. Let's start with \"Olivia\". "

    "I originally wanted to investigate this to see what types of jobs the LLM would assign to these two characters without any other information about them other than their names, which are typically associated with one gender over the other. For \"Olivia\", she was given an office job that seems to deal with finance or data. \"Jonathan\" was given an engineering/architect job with papers that look like blueprints for a building. Depending on the field, office jobs tend to be made up of more women than men; however, there is still a fairly even split. Architecture and Civil Engineering on the other hand is quite a bit more divided. Engineering as a whole is very male-dominated. I had asked the LLM why it chose the respective professions for each name and this stood out to me about \"Jonathan\": \n",

    "Hmm, this is interesting! It didn't say anything like this for \"Olivia\". Perhaps it would be interesting in the future to dissect why a common name like \"Jonathan\" would be a classic fit for someone in a leadership/senior role. "
