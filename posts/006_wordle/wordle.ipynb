    "Although ChatGPT may not have the best reputation when it comes to solving word puzzles, so far, it seems to be able to solve Wordle! One thing that I wanted to note is that the LLM took a bit longer for each successive round. From round 1 to round 2, it thought for a \"few seconds\". From round 2 to round 3, it thought for 9 seconds. THen, from round 3 to round 4, it thought for 11 seconds. I am assuming it was going through potential options to narrow down ones that fit the criteria as the criteria became more and more specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT didn't have bad guesses, but they still weren't optimal. As shown by Wordle Bot, each word after the first was rate a skill number less than 80. However, I think it did a good job in removing words. This may have also been a fault of my own prompts because I worded it in a way that hinted that guesses had the keep the correct letters already guessed. If this was not the case, perhaps the LLM may have guessed the 'optimal' word, as determined by Wordle Bot. "
