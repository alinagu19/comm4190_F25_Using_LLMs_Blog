    "> *   **Melancholy:** There's a gentle, underlying sadness, not despair, but a quiet pensiveness. It feels like reflecting on something beautiful but lost, or a bittersweet truth.\n",
    "> *   **Nostalgia:** A strong sense of looking back, perhaps at a past relationship or a simpler time, with a blend of fondness and regret.\n",
    "> *   **Tenderness/Affection:** Despite the melancholy, there's a deep warmth and affection in the vocal delivery and the gentle harmonies. It feels like a loving observation of someone or something complex.\n",
    "> *   **Vulnerability:** The singer's voice, especially with the close harmonies, conveys a sense of openness and honesty.\n",

    "> *   **Two people sitting close, but in quiet contemplation:** Not necessarily speaking, just existing together in a shared, intimate space.\n",
    "> *   **A rustic, cozy cabin:** Warm wood, soft light, a crackling fire, a sense of being sheltered from the outside world while reflecting on it.\n",
    "> *   The lyrics, particularly \"I slithered through from Eden, just to sit outside your door,\" paint a vivid picture of patient longing and a journey from a lost paradise to a hopeful, albeit somewhat distant, presence.\n",

    "> \"Imagine a crisp autumn morning, sitting by a window, watching the world wake up slowly. This music feels like **a gentle, thoughtful conversation with yourself about someone you deeply cherish**, who might be complex or even a bit broken, but whose essence still captivates you. It's profoundly **bittersweet, laced with tender longing and a touch of wistful nostalgia**. The acoustic guitars and the singer's heartfelt voice create an incredibly intimate atmosphere, like someone is sharing their most private reflections right beside you. It evokes images of cherished memories, quiet contemplation, and the enduring nature of love despite imperfections or past hurts. It's the perfect soundtrack for introspection, for savoring moments of quiet beauty and the bittersweet realities of life and relationships.\""

    "This song makes me feel bittersweet in a way. There's a tone of melancholy and tragedy that the lyrics portray that's also very dramatic. I think overall Gemini did a pretty good job of coming up with emotional descriptions because it came up with really similar descriptions to that. There are certain nuances to the lyrics that feel different than the melody, which I think the LLM overlooked. It definitely has fall season and rustic vibes, but that is also reflective of the artist in general, so I'm not sure how unique that description is to the song. "
