    "In terms of creating travel itineraries, Google: Gemini actually does a pretty good job. It gives a proper amount of specificity that is very helpful. It included everything that I originally required and also was able to create a new itinerary based on my new time constraint. I was hoping for a more concise layout for the response, but that likely means I would have to refine my prompt since looking back, it was a bit vague. Something I am curious about is the wait times for the food, which it didn't seem like the LLM took into account. I wonder if it would be possible for it to compile average wait times from online data and then incorporate that into the schedule? I'm excited to go tonight and try out Gemini's recommendations!"
