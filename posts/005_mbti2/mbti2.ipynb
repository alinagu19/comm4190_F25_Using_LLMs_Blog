    "I asked ChatGPT-5 to create a 'Day-in-the-life' story of someone who has this MBTI. This was the response:\n",
    ">Evelyn’s alarm rang at 6:15 sharp, just as it did every weekday. She liked the predictability of mornings — coffee brewed while she folded yesterday’s laundry, a short walk around the block before sitting down at her desk. By 8:00, she was in the office, checking her to-do list against the team’s shared calendar. A colleague had forgotten to submit a report, so she quietly picked up the slack, knowing it was easier to handle it herself than risk the deadline being missed.\n",
    "Lunch was always the same — a packed container of leftovers, eaten while she skimmed through local news. She preferred her routines; they gave her a sense of calm when everything else felt uncertain.\n",
    "In the evening, she stopped by her parents’ house to drop off groceries. They hadn’t asked, but she noticed last week they were running low on basics, and it made her feel better knowing she could help. Later, back at home, she finished the day with a book she’d already read twice. The familiar story was like an anchor, grounding her before bed.\n",
    "It wasn’t a flashy life, but it was steady. And for Evelyn, there was comfort in knowing she could be counted on — for herself, and for the people who mattered most.\n",

    "> - **Thinking (T):** She’s pragmatic and logical — choosing to complete a colleague’s task to avoid missed deadlines, not out of emotional impulse.\n",
    "> - **Judging (J):** Her life runs on structure: alarms, calendars, routines, and predictability. She thrives on order and responsibility.\n",
    "\n",

    "I was somewhat expecting Copilot to be able to guess from the description of the personality. From its rationale, it seemed like the description matched key words that the LLM was specifically looking for. When I decided to use the story, I thought it would be a bit more difficult for the LLM to discern the MBTI since character traits were less explicit and hidden inside actions, meaning it would have to look deeper into the character's actions. However, after reading Copilot's logical reasoning after mapping it to the ISTJ profile, it does an intuitive job that is quite impressive. It higlights the character's ability to \"be grounded in the present\" and \"choosing to complete a colleague's task\" for pragmatic reasons and not emotional ones. The latter observation specifically piqued my interest because I think it requires a higher level of intuition to notice that and have that reasoning. "
