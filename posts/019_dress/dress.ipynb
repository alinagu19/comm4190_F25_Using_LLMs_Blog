    "\n",
    "### Price & sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "All picks are priced **under $200** at their primary retailer (the exact price can fluctuate with sales).

(See each product’s page for up-to-date stock and exact price).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick styling tips for graduation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shoes: low block heels or classy mules — comfortable for walking across a stage and photogenic.\n",
    "* Outer layer: a lightweight blazer or cropped cardigan if your ceremony’s in an air-conditioned hall.\n",
    "* Jewelry: simple studs + a delicate necklace keeps the look refined; pick one statement piece (earrings or bracelet) rather than many.\n",
    "* Bag: a small clutch or mini shoulder bag to hold phone/ID — keep it neutral or metallic.\n",
    "* Undergarments: consider strapless/adhesive options for corsets or cowl backs, and seamless nude undergarments for satin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fit & return notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because brands vary, I recommend checking each product’s **return policy** and measuring yourself (bust/waist/hips) against the retailer chart. If you prefer guaranteed fit, prioritize retailers with free returns or in-store pickup.\n",

    "2. **ASOS DESIGN — Satin Bandeau Gathered-Waist Mini (white)** — slinky satin bandeau with a gathered waist for shaping; same short/fitted mini silhouette but with a satin finish for subtle shine. Often available with free returns. (Seen on ASOS product page.) ([ASOS][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Oh Polly — “Eliselle Embellished Strapless Mini Dress (Ivory)”** — a slightly more dressed-up option: structured strapless corset shape with an adjustable lace-up back for a very secure fit and a fitted mini skirt (good if you want sparkle/details). ([Oh Polly US][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Meshki — Strapless Mini styles (white options)** — Meshki frequently carries several fitted strapless/bandeau minis with corset-like shaping and clean hems — a modern, fashion-forward take on the fitted mini. Check their strapless collection for specific models in white. ([MESHKI US][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Oh Polly — “Basel / other strapless/cowl-beaded minis”** — Oh Polly also offers more embellished and mesh-overlaid strapless minis (curve-accentuating bodycon silhouettes) if you liked Moonlight Magic’s fitted shape but want extra texture/embellishment. ([Oh Polly US][5])\n",

    "* **Sizing:** You wear a US size 4 — that usually maps to Small on many of these brands, but **measure bust/underbust and compare to each retailer’s size chart before ordering**. ASOS and Lulus often have easy return policies if a size tweak is needed.\n",

    "I thought it'd be really cool to try this on my own since there's a group exploring this usage of the LLM with their final project. All in all, ChatGPT-5.2 did pretty good! I'm a really particular person, so I probably won't buy any of these, but, regardless, the LLM did a good job of staying within the requests. I also really liked how it gave links and had some tips included regarding sizing and support. It pulled options from a wide variety of stores (that are on the more popular side, which impressed me). Out of all the options, I think either 1 or 2 were not in stock in my size, so it's not completely reliable, but it does still make dress shopping much more manageable!"
