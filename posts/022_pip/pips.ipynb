    "I have a few other blog posts seeing how ChatGPT can solve the various New York Times Games. Since then, a new one has been introduced: Pips! Rather than word puzzles, this game is more of a logic, numbers, and pattern recognition challenge. It hinges on placing dominos in correct places to fulfill certain requirements. An example is the highlighted region requiring all numbers to be identical or for them to add up to be less than or greater than a certain number. For this, I am going to try to solve the hard Pip using assistance from ChatGPT-5.2. Since this game is very visual, let's see how the LLM fares. "

It's honestly more tedious to keep copy and pasting the image into the LLM than it is to try an reason through it.
