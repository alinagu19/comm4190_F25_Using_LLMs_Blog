    "+ This could've been due to the prompt not being very descriptive, but neither LLM really 'disagreed' with the previous sentence. Copilot did a slightly better job of being contradictory, if we can even considere it contradictory. Chat-GPT, however, consistently just added onto what Copilot was saying. This is more reflective of the \"Yes, and...\" activity we did. Copilot added new ideas while Chat-GPT built on the ideas already given. "

    "Overlooking the fact that neither LLM did a great job at following the general goal of the 'No, but...' prompt, I was pleasantly surprised by the ideas and the level of whimsy they achieved. I was a bit worried the LLMs would be too literal with the prompt and not be 'imaginative' (or at least what imaginative means to an AI chatbot). However, I thought both came up with really good ideas, something that I likely would not have come up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I noticed that both LLMs stayed on topic, whereas when we did this improv activity in class between two people, we tended to veer insanely off path. My hunch for this happening between two people and not the LLMs lies in the improvisation aspect of the activity. From personal experience, I found it difficult to think of things on the spot that were somewhat 'reasonable' for the topic of interest. Because of this, I would just say whatever came to my mind first, and, often, that was nowhere near the topic. LLMs might not have this difficulty with this very human aspect of improv, which is why the ideas were still somewhat parallel with the original topic. "
