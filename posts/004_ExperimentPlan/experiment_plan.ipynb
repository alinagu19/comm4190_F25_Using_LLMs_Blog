    "Designing experiments in the lab takes a lot of effort and critical thinking. Additionally, you have to think of the feasibility and cost of such tasks. In my opinion, I find it difficult to be incredibly thorough why my experimental controls. For those that may not be as familiar with science experiments, controls are conditions that are kept constant. In essence, they act as benchmarks to compare the results of the experiment to. They help determine whether or not a change was significant or not. They help scientists determine if the changes in results are truly due to the factor being tested and not an external element. "

    "\n",
    "-Investigate whether EBV promotes the development of the age-associated B cell (ABC) phenotype and inflammation in memory B cells via CD21 receptor internalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Use gene editing, specifically CRISPR-Cas9, to knock out CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in Mun-14 (an EBV+ B cell line that was adapted for increased neuroinvasion)16 and spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCLs) to interrogate their roles in EBV-mediated inflammation and neuroinvasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Examine neuroinvasion in vivo using mouse models to track the distribution and localization of cells following receptor gene knockout\n",
    "\n",
    "-Assess changes in inflammasome pathway gene expression following deletion of CD21, CXCR3, and/or CXCR4 in SLCLs derived from both active MS patients and healthy controls (also including unstimulated vs. stimulated). \n",
    "\n",
    "-Determine whether CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 function independently from each other or interact in common inflammatory and pro-migratory pathways. \n"
