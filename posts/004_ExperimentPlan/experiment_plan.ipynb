    "Designing experiments in the lab takes a lot of effort and critical thinking. Additionally, you have to think of the feasibility and cost of such tasks. In my opinion, I find it difficult to be incredibly thorough why my experimental controls. For those that may not be as familiar with science experiments, controls are conditions that are kept constant. In essence, they act as benchmarks to compare the results of the experiment to. They help determine whether or not a change was significant or not. They help scientists determine if the changes in results are truly due to the factor being tested and not an external element. "

    "-Investigate whether EBV promotes the development of the age-associated B cell (ABC) phenotype and inflammation in memory B cells via CD21 receptor internalization. \n",

    "-Use gene editing, specifically CRISPR-Cas9, to knock out CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 in Mun-14 (an EBV+ B cell line that was adapted for increased neuroinvasion)16 and spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCLs) to interrogate their roles in EBV-mediated inflammation and neuroinvasion.\n",

    "-Examine neuroinvasion in vivo using mouse models to track the distribution and localization of cells following receptor gene knockout\n",
    "\n",
    "-Assess changes in inflammasome pathway gene expression following deletion of CD21, CXCR3, and/or CXCR4 in SLCLs derived from both active MS patients and healthy controls (also including unstimulated vs. stimulated). \n",
    "\n",
    "-Determine whether CD21, CXCR3, and CXCR4 function independently from each other or interact in common inflammatory and pro-migratory pathways. \n"

    "In terms of controls, Chat-GPT was able to identify most of what was needed. It was really interesting to see that the LLM recommend the same mouse breed that my lab actually does use in our research, mainly because there are tons of research mouse breeds used and it was able to guess the correct one. One thing that I wasn't familiar with was the Transwell/Blood-Brain Barrier Assay. That was something we hadn't even thought of because we have an established animal facility and can easily have access to animal studies. However, if we didn't, this would be a good model to see the initial feasibility of neuroinvasion. Everything else seems very similar to the actual plan of my project!\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, given the correct background and initial questions, I think LLMs are capable to delivering a preliminary proposal. This is incredibly beneficial because it is difficult to create a complete and thorough experiment from the bottom up. This provides a solid foundation to build off of. I did want to add that there are some gaps in the process here, and something that the LLM doesn't take into account is the capabilities and availabilities of the lab itself. Not every lab has access to flow cytometry, for example. "
