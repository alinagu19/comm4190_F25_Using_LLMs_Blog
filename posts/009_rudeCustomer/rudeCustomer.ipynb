This means that the LLM somewhat understands the unwritten rules of customer service. For the second prompt, it felt that the LLM went a bit further on acknowledging the customer's frustrations. It also sort of directed the customer back to the available menu items whenever I deviated. Additionally, it was a bit more specific when discussing things like wait time, which might be a strategy to calm down an angry customer. "
