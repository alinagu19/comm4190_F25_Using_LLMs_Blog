    "This part is more of a validation step for the next part as well as an investigation into how well LLMs understand the nuances of different persoality types beyond what is just directly stated. in terms of validity, I do see myself in a lot of these descriptions (it is my personality type after all). The ones that especially stood out to me were 'Challenges', 'Work Style', 'Relationships'. I think these were extremely on the nose. I think one thing in particular doesn't necessarily fit: \"Struggle with Abstract or Theoretical Ideas\", but I think for me, this is a skill that came with time. Additionally, it has been a while since I've gotten this result, so it is a possibility that I am no longer this \"personality\""

I am not sure how LLMs are programmed to act based on opinion-based questions, but I am intriguied that it took somewhat of a stance. I wonder how far its opinions will go?"
