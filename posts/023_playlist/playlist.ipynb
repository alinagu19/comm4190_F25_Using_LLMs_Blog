My top five songs of the year were “I Will Be Back One Day” by Lord Huron, “Cosmic Love” by Florence + The Machine, “Which Witch” by Florence + The Machine, “Passenger” by Noah Kahan, and “Over My Head (Cable Car)” by the Fray. Create an hour-long playlist that fits this vibe and don't include these songs or artists. "

    "Anthropic/Claude-3.7 actually read the vibe of my top artists and songs really well! I know the majority of the songs on this list and a good chunk of them are also on my playlist already. I did find it interesting how the LLM included covers of songs originally sung by the artists on my list. Anthropic/Claude also did a good job on the runtime, making it quite close to the time constraint that I requested. I'm curious if I were to upload my entire Spotify profile how well the LLM would perform, considering it already did a great job with the short list that I gave it. I would actually use an LLM to create playlists in the future for different occasions. I wonder how good it can do with just a general occasion/vibe rather than a list of my top artists and songs. "
