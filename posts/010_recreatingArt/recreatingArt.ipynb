    "> The portrait depicts a young woman with fair skin with larger eyes and a rounder face. Her body is facing away from the painter but her head is turned so she is looking towards the painter. We can see only about three quarters of her face. She is wearing a yellow dutch jacket that covers her shoulders and we can only see her shoulders and above. She is wearing an 'oriental' headress that is blue around the headband and yellow elsewhere. She also has a large pearl earring dangling from her left ear. Create an original image.  "

    "Although I was fairly impressed by Chat-GPT5's ability to recreate the original 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' painting solely on a description, it's ability to create something original is quite disappointing. The LLM doesn't seem to grasp anatomy all that well and it changes small, but instrumental, details without me prompting it to do so. Thorughout the process, it appears that the gaze and innocence of the girl was lost. Additionally, I thought that it was odd that Chat-GPT5 chose to crop the jacket at that length because normally they are longer. It was impressive, however, that the LLM was able to keep the integrity of the oil painting style. When asked to extend the painting, it felt fairly cohesive, but only for the style and painting strokes. "
