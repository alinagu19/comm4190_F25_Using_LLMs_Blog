<p>Graduation is a big milestone that can bring up a mix of emotions. It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about it. You might be excited about new opportunities while also feeling nostalgic about your college experience ending. Are you having any specific thoughts or concerns about post-graduation life? Whatever you’re feeling - whether it’s excitement, anxiety, or a combination - is valid as you approach this transition.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That mix of excitement and worry is so common with big life transitions. The anticipation of something new can be thrilling - finally putting your education to work, more independence, new experiences ahead of you. But those same changes can naturally trigger worry too.</p>
<p>What aspects of this new chapter are you most looking forward to? And which parts feel most concerning to you?</p>
<p>graduates find themselves in this exact emotional space - proud of their accomplishment while also wondering “what now?” The uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but it’s also full of possibilities.</p>

<p>I’ll be taking a gap year before going to medical school, so there will be a bit of time before I get to be in school again. I’m scared that things won’t be the same since my friends will be moving away.</p>

<p>That makes a lot of sense. A gap year before medical school is a significant transition, especially when your social circle is changing at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s natural to worry about those friendships evolving as everyone moves in different directions. College creates this unique environment where your friends are constantly nearby, and that dynamic will definitely shift. The good news is that meaningful friendships can absolutely survive distance and changing circumstances, though they might look different.</p>
<p>Your gap year also offers some unique opportunities - perhaps time to pursue experiences that will enrich your medical school journey, or to develop relationships in new contexts.</p>
<p>What are you thinking about doing during your gap year? And have you and your friends talked about how you’ll stay connected?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Having that conversation with your friends before everyone scatters can be really valuable. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plan a “transition talk” - maybe over dinner or coffee - where you openly discuss your hopes for staying connected. This might feel a bit formal, but explicitly acknowledging the change can be reassuring.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up some regular virtual touchpoints - maybe a monthly group video call that becomes a standing date on everyone’s calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider starting a group chat specifically for sharing life updates if you don’t already have one.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan tentative in-person reunions for holidays or long weekends when people might return to your college town.</p></li>
<li><p>Create shared digital spaces - whether that’s a private social media group, a shared photo album, or even collaborative playlists.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The key is being intentional about maintaining those connections while also being realistic that the dynamics will evolve. What do you think might work best with your particular friend group?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Shared digital spaces sound perfect for your group! They’re flexible and don’t require everyone to be available at the same time.</p>
<p>You could create: - A private Instagram or Facebook group where everyone shares their new experiences - A shared Google Photos album for visual updates - A Discord server with different channels for various topics - A collaborative Spotify playlist that evolves as everyone discovers new music in their new locations</p>
<p>The beauty of digital spaces is they keep everyone connected while respecting that everyone will be on different schedules during your gap year and their new journeys.</p>
<p>I hope this transition goes smoothly for you. Taking that gap year before medical school while maintaining those important friendships will likely give you the best of both worlds - time to prepare for your medical career and the support of friends who know you well.</p>

<p>Graduating is a major life event, and it’s completely normal to have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it marks the end of an important chapter and the beginning of a new one filled with opportunities and possibilities. On the other hand, it can bring about uncertainty and concern about the future.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to reflect on both the aspects that excite you and those that concern you. Are there specific things you’re looking forward to or anxious about? Sharing your thoughts with friends or mentors could also provide support and new perspectives.</p>
<p>Remember, feeling a blend of emotions is completely normal and part of the process. Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes up as you approach this transition.</p>

<p>It’s perfectly normal to feel both excited and worried about starting a new chapter. Transitioning from college to whatever comes next is a big change, and with change comes both opportunity and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The excitement you feel can be a great motivator as you think about new experiences, meeting new people, and setting off on your own path. At the same time, the worry can stem from the unknown and leaving behind the familiar environment of college life.</p>
<p>To navigate these feelings, consider focusing on some practical steps: - <strong>Set goals:</strong> Think about what you want to achieve in this next chapter, both personally and professionally. Setting goals can provide direction and a sense of control. - <strong>Stay connected:</strong> Keep in touch with friends and mentors who can offer support and advice as you move forward. They can be a great source of encouragement. - <strong>Embrace the unknown:</strong> Remind yourself that it’s okay not to have everything figured out. Being open to new experiences can lead to unexpected and rewarding opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s a time of both excitement and apprehension, and both feelings are perfectly valid. You’re not alone in experiencing this mix, and it’s part of what makes this transition both challenging and rewarding.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-remarks">My Remarks</h2>
<p>Typically, I’d be a bit wary about using an LLM as a pseudo-therapist, but from this simple interaction, there is definitely one that is better than the other. After interacting with both in the most similar way possible, Anthropic/Claude was much more interactive and engaging. It consistently asked me questions about my OWN feelings and worked to validate them by using reaffirming techniques. Furthermore, the suggestions that it gave were more specific than ChatGPT’s answer. I personally really liked the “shared digital spaces” idea. It doesn’t require constant checking in, but it allows for constant feelings of closeness without much effort.</p>
<p>Now moving onto the ChatGPT interaction, it felt much more shallow and the questions didn’t feel as tailored to me as Claude’s questions did. The practical steps of “Set goals”, “Stay connected”, “Embrace the unknown” feel very generic and the elaborations aren’t very helpful either. On the other hand, it is also very affirming towards my thoughts and feelings. It feels very similar to Person-centered therapy, which is just the therapist repeating a client’s words back to them to show understanding and induce deeper thought. It works to an extent, but this is what the conversation with ChatGPT felt like. It wasn’t as productive as the conversation with Anthropic/Claude.</p>
