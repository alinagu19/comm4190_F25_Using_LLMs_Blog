    "Something that immediately stands out is that without the prompt. Chat-GPT starts with a very general description of the figure, outlining each individual part and clarifying the experimental groups. Both versions give descriptions of the bands; however, the one with the prompt is much more detailed and it explains the logic more clearly. Both give fairly sound interpretations, but the answer given from the prompt contextualizes the results moreso than the answer without the prompt. \n",

    "Chat-GPT is surprisingly able to extract a lot of data and reasoning within scientific figures. I personally find interpreting blot data, especially ones with so many experimental condiitons, quite challenging because most of the time, they are different forms of controls. But, Chat-GPT is a really good tool to help understand them."
