    "**Bracket City** is a nested clue word puzzle game made by *The Atlantic*. You start with short phrases that act as clues to a word. Then that word helps you make sense of 'outer' phrases, which then hint at other clues. Essentially, you work your way out (hence the 'nested' part) until you solve the whole puzzle. Shout out Came"
